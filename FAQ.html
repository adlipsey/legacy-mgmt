			"You may need DMM services due to a physical change precipitated by the aging process, such as limited vision, arthritis or other conditions which limit the ability to write, or see clearly, or you may find following through on tasks difficult.

If day-to-day paperwork is becoming overwhelming, a Daily Money Manager may be just what you need to get your personal business organized. <br /> Many adult children of an aging parent seek the assistance of a DMM if the adult child does not have the time, proximity, or ability to maintain their parents’ affairs.",
