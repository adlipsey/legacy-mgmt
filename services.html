				<h3>What Is Daily Money Management?</h3>
					<p>Legacy Management, Inc. offers a Daily Money Management service and system tailored to the needs of seniors, which can then be modified to fit the specific needs of each client. The Daily Money Management service affords many seniors the support they require to successfully manage their independence.</p> 
					<p>Most often, we work with clients in their own homes, with our clients directing and controlling their own affairs.  Our support is professional and confidential, with a variety of problem-solving skills to meet nearly every business need.</p>

				<h3>Daily Money Management Services</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Paying bills and balancing the checkbook</li>
						<li>Filing and organizing financial documents</li>
						<li>Tracking expenses for tax purposes</li>
						<li>Avoiding lost or illegible checks</li>
						<li>Safe identity practices and mail fraud prevention</li>
						<li>Implementing and tracking direct deposits to bank accounts</li>
						<li>Limiting over payment for services, merchandise or donations</li> 
						<li>Timely bill payment( avoids service charges and late fees)</li>
						<li>Filing medical insurance claims & resolution of disputed claims</li>
						<li>Providing periodic financial statements or reports</li>
						<li>Consumer advocacy to resolve problems and billing disputes</li>
					</ul>
				<p>We also offer a service that maintains the client's check register on Quickbooks, which is reconciled monthly with their bank statement. The Quickbooks check register is often more accurate than the clients' check register, plus it allows expenses to be categorized for tax deductions (as available), along with tracking to assist with future financial planning. Many clients prefer to have us print out their check register in a large print format for easier use when logging payments & reading balances.</p>
				<h3>Document Organization</h3>
				<p>We provide an easy-to-use system for keeping track of financial records.  
				PS Files&trade; for Seniors, is a unique paper management system that addresses senior-specific areas such as Medicare, long term care insurance, retirement assets, income and fraud protection.  It is a kit we use with each client -- our tool to help the client manage everyday mail, bills, checks, and correspondence. Our patented filing system is available exclusively to our clients as a complimentary part of our Daily Money Management service.</p>
